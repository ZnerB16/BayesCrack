# Crack Identification Classifier Mobile App

This mobile application serves as a comprehensive tool for capturing and classifying severity of concrete cracks.

This mobile application is made for the deployment of the best-performing deep learning model based on model accuracy loss, and other evaluation metrics in the thesis project of

The thesis project is entitled "ENHANCING CONCRETE CRACK SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION USING BAYESIAN CNN AND DEEPCRACK ARCHITECTURE". 

The researchers aim to know the potential of modifying Bayesian CNN, DeepCrack Architecture, and creating  an ensemble model named BayesCrack Convolutional Ensemble (BCCE) for multiclass classification of concrete crack severity, evaluate overall performance, and deploy a deep learning model for real life application. The thesis project intends to improve the step towards automated image-based monitoring strategies in concrete crack severity classification.

During training and evaluation of the three deep learning models, the BayesCrack Convolutional Ensemble (BCCE) demonstrated the highest performance and proved itself to be the best performing model. The model was exported and deployed in this mobile application.

The mobile application attained % accuracy, exhibiting a high-level performance in practical settings. Furthermore, the application requires an average time of seconds to capture and classify concrete cracks, demonstrating a faster speed compared to a traditional non-destructive technique using a caliper.
