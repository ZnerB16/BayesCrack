# Crack Identification Classifier Mobile App

This mobile application serves as a comprehensive tool for capturing and classifying severity of concrete cracks.

This mobile application is made for the deployment of the best-performing deep learning model based on model accuracy, loss, and other evaluation metrics in the thesis project entitled:

**ENHANCING CONCRETE CRACK SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION USING BAYESIAN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK AND DEEPCRACK ARCHITECTURE**

The researcher for the thesis project are:

    Raven E. Cagulang
    Francis Ryan C. Diesto
    Brenz Gwynne M. Hababag
    Kyra Jyne A. Melendres

The thesis project intends to improve the step towards automated image-based monitoring strategies in concrete crack severity classification. 

The researchers aim to know the potential of modifying Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN), DeepCrack Architecture, and creating  an ensemble model named BayesCrack Convolutional Ensemble (BCCE) for multiclass image classification of concrete crack severity.

During training and evaluation of the three deep learning models, the BayesCrack Convolutional Ensemble (BCCE) demonstrated the highest performance and proved itself to be the best performing model. The model was exported and deployed in this mobile application.

The modification of the BCNN, DeepCrack Architecture, and the deployment of BCCE into a practical application contribute to the advancement of concrete crack severity classification in the field of artificial intelligence and engineering. The findings demonstrate the immense potential of deep learning models in automating concrete crack severity classification to enhance public safety.
